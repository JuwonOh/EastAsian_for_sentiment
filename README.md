# EastAsian_for_sentiment

This is an analysis of the data of US media companies in China, Korea and Japan. The press used was CNN, Fox News, New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall streat jounal. The article runs from January 1, 2019 to June 31, 2019.
The entire article was divided into sentences, and each country or major person was considered a sentence corresponding to each country. The emotion analyzer used VADER Sentiment Analysis based on the emotion dictionary.
 The VADER Sentiment Analysis is very simple but shows similar feelings in articles written by other media about the same time and the same country.
We will code the data directly afterward and compare it with the results learned through supervised learning.
